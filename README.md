Project report detailing software design can be found as a PDF file in the 'NXT Files' fodler. For any additional explanation or clarification, contact Allen Gurdus at allen.gurdus@gmail.com

REQUIRED HARDWARE:
1) Legos Mindstorm kit with NXT brick and all sensors assembled as described and shown in the Final Project Report.
2) Bluetooth ready PC.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The objective of the project is to create a "bomb" capturing robot that can be controlled from a PC. The "bomb" is a tin can at an unknown location in a maze. The robot is controlled form another room and thus must use sensors to relay infomration about its location, surroundings and status back to its operator. Location can be determined only by tracking the robots motion's and by calculation using two light bulbs (identified by light sensor on robot). The ultrasonic sensor and "bumper" sensors on the robot are used for observing and mapping obstacles and walls.
